# qpFlipper

Quite progressive web application to work with your Flipper.

qpFlipper is a opinionated fork (WIP) of lab.flipper.net.

qpFlipper is intended to be intuitive and feature-rich. With file viewing/editing and so on. The idea is to have feature-parity with qFlipper, android-flipper, and add something extra.
